# JunkTest
Junk project for testing some things.  THERE IS NO USEFUL CODE HERE.

There will never be useful code here.  This exists purely for me to get used to Git, the ideas behind Redgate's excellant source control software and something to distract me from the insanity of evening television in the UK.
